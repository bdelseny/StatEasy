# Metting 15 April 2017

## Points 

- Glossary
- Scenario 2
- Modelisation tools
- Existing R tools

## Glossary

- Technique glossary : Explication of words used in a technical way (regroup all three at the moment)
- Applicative glossary : Glossary of our software use (linked to technical glossary)
- Methodologic glossary : Tools used and how to use / install them (tool.md)
- Existing technical glossary :
  - Statistical analysis : TOCHANGE
  - Data Analysis : Data management + first first look on data + used for directing statistical analysis (can use statistics, generaly graphical statistics as correspondence analysis / charts)
  - Statistical analysis : applying statistics on data, showing and "proving" things by using statistical methods
  - Data management : making data usable for further analysis
  - Statistics : TODO
  - Statistics functions : can be mathematical statistic functions or implementation informatic as in R.
  - Doing a tree structure (hierachy) for definitions Statistics > statistics functions > mathematical statistics functions
- Completing technical glossary
- Methodological glossary : TODO : how to install tools (Windows/Linux) and how to use them for the project

## Scenario 2 (Aboarded)

## Modelisation tools

- UMLet http://www.umlet.com/ (eclipse plug-in) , not easy to use
- violet uml http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor/page.php , easy to use, not all diagram and diagram options
- modelio https://www.modelio.org/ , ergonomix but time to time difficult to use,
really complete
 
## Existing R tools

- DataExplorer https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer , Data analysis, (data managment ?) TOTEST, TOIMPLEMENT ? R package
- RStudio : https://www.rstudio.com/ , https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio , Complete IDE. See if we can use it for StatEasy

## TODO

- Completing glossaries (P1)
- Modelisation scenatio 2 (P2)
- Looking at tools / feedback on them (P2)
- Planification further metting (P0)
