# Glossaire Technique / Technical Glossary


**Analysis** :  


**Beginner** :  


**C++** :  
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic 
programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained 
and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

**CRAN** :  
CRAN stands for Comprehensive R Archive Network.

**Criteria** :  


**Data** :  


**Data Analysis** :  


**Database** :  
A database is an organized collection of data. The data are typically organized to model aspects 
of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database))

**Dataset** :  


**Export** :  


**File** :  
A computer file is a computer resource for recording data discretely in a computer storage device.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file))

**Fonction** / **Function** :  
* *Mathematical Function* : In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs 
and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)))
* *Function (computer science)* : ([source](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Function+(computer+science)))  
  *  A set of instructions that performs a specific task for a main routine, requiring direction back 
to the proper place in the main routine on completion of the task.
  *  A section of a computer program that is stored only once but can be used when required at several 
different points in the program, thus saving space. Also called: procedure or routine or sub-routine.

**Format** :  
* *File Format* : A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. 
It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either 
proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format))

**Import** :  


**Input** :  


**MRAN** :  
MRAN stands for Microsoft R Application Network.

**Ordered** :  


**Output** :  


**R** :  
<a name="R"></a>
R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics 
that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)))

**R Language** :  
See [R](#R).

**R Package** :  
Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, 
the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.
([source](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/))

**R Studio** :  
RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio))

**Report** :  


**Software** :  
Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of data or 
computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. 
In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, 
programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, 
such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither 
can be realistically used on its own.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software))

**Specification** : ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)))  
* *Requirement Specification* : A set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, 
design, product, or service.
* *Functionnal Specification* : A functional specification is closely related to the requirement 
specification and may show functional block diagrams.
* *Technical Specification* : Refer to technical standards, which may be developed by any of various 
kinds of organizations, both public and private.

**StatEasy** :  


**Statistical Analysis** :  
See [Statistics](#Statistics).

**Statistics** :  
<a name="Statistics"></a>
Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, 
and organization of data.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics))

**System** :  


**Use Case** :  
<a name="UseCase"></a>
In software and systems engineering, a use case is a list of actions or event steps, typically defining 
the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language as an actor) and a system, 
to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case))

**Use Case Diagram** :  
A diagram used to illustrate different [Use Cases](#UseCase) for a given system.
