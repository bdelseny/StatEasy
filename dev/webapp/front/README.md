# Front

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

# Before developing

## Needed tools

- npm : a package manager needed for yarn and angular-cli to run
- yarn : for installing modules needed and to launch front server
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) : for starting front server
- Visual Studio Code : for developing code. It is the best editor for developing in TypeScript. It needs some plugin installed to be even more usefull. (recommended plugins : [TSlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint))

## Development server

Run `ng set --global pacakgeManager=yarn` to set yarn as default package manager.

Run `yarn start` for a dev server, your default browser should launch automatically on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). If your browser has not launch you can navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `yarn serve`.
